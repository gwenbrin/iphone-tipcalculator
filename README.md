iphone-tipcalculator
====================

A tip calculator app for iPhone that supports bill splitting.

## Process

* Followed Tim Lee's tutorial: http://vimeo.com/74764846
* Rearranged the UI so user input is consolidated at the top and visible when the keyboard is up
* Added in bill splitting fuctionality
* Created a reciept-like view for calculation result

## Improvements to be Made

* When split value is empty, "Price per person" should be blank instead of null or inf
* The "Split" label doesn't make the field's funtionality 100% clear to the users
