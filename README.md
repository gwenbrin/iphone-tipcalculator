iphone-tipcalculator
====================

A tip calculator app for iPhone that supports bill splitting.

## Process

* Followed Tim Lee's tutorial: http://vimeo.com/74764846
* Rearranged the UI so user input is consolidated at the top and visible when the keyboard is up
* Added in bill splitting fuctionality
* Created a reciept-like view for calculation result

## Improvements to be Made

* Add a done button on the keyboards
* Consider using a number stepper for split (bills are not likely going to be split with over 10 people)
* When split value is empty, Price per person should be blank instead of null or inf
* The Split label doesn't make the field's funtionality 100% clear to the users
* Add a Clear button to reset the fields to their original state
